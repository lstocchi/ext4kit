# Supported features

## Current status

The formatter currently creates valid ext4 images with a 4 KiB block size and
256-byte inodes. It writes sparse-superblock layout (including backups and
group descriptors), block and inode bitmaps, inode tables, the root directory,
and `lost+found`.

It supports regular files across fragmented block runs, building multi-level
extent trees when needed. Directories have `.` and `..` entries, update parent
link counts, and grow across multiple blocks, including fragmented
extent-backed directories. Symlinks use inline storage below 60 bytes and one
data-block extent for longer targets.

Character and block devices, FIFOs, and Unix-domain sockets use
Linux-compatible device-number encoding. Files and directories support POSIX
permissions, 32-bit UID/GID, access/change/modification timestamps, external
xattr blocks with deterministic e2fsprogs-compatible hashes, and conversion
of `system.posix_acl_access` / `system.posix_acl_default` into compact ext4
ACL encoding.

The demonstration image contains:

```text
/
├── lost+found/
└── test_dir/
    └── hello.txt
```

`hello.txt` contains `Created by ext4kit` and has `user.creator=ext4kit`.

## Metadata API

Creation methods accept `PosixMetadata`:

```rust
let metadata = PosixMetadata {
    mode: 0o640,
    uid: 1000,
    gid: 1000,
    mtime: 1_700_000_000,
    ..Default::default()
};

let directory = builder.mkdir(EXT4_ROOT_INO, "app", Some(&metadata))?;
builder.add_file(directory, "config", b"enabled=true\n", &metadata)?;
builder.add_symlink(directory, "current", "config", &metadata)?;
builder.add_char_device(directory, "null", 1, 3, &metadata)?;
builder.add_fifo(directory, "events", &metadata)?;
```

Xattr keys use fully qualified Linux names such as `user.comment`,
`security.capability`, `trusted.overlay.opaque`, and
`system.posix_acl_access`. Each inode currently gets one unshared external
4 KiB xattr block; oversized sets fail before allocation state changes.

Regular files and directories may span fragmented runs. Extent-tree metadata
is added automatically when extents do not fit in the inode. Directory growth
reserves its data and required extent-tree blocks before creating a child, and
reclaims replaced extent-tree blocks.

Symlink targets may be empty and may contain at most `BLOCK_SIZE - 1` bytes
(4,095 bytes with 4 KiB blocks). Targets under 60 bytes are inline; longer
targets occupy one data block. Inline-data symlinks are not implemented.

Device methods accept a Linux major number up to 4,095 and minor number up to
1,048,575. Special nodes do not allocate data extents, though they may use an
external xattr block.

## Editing existing images

`Ext4ImageBuilder::open` loads an image that ext4kit wrote back into the
builder, and `ext4kit edit` exposes path-level operations on it: `rm`,
`mkdir`, `chmod`, `chown` (recursive without following symlinks), `add`,
`write` (in-place content replacement that keeps the inode, links, timestamps
and xattrs), `cat`, `test` and `ln`. Images in any other format, including
those made by `mke2fs`, are rejected. The image size is fixed. See
[Editing images](editing.md).

## Design constraints and limitations

- Image creation runs on Windows; Linux tools are only optional verification.
- Layout is modeled on `e2fsprogs` and written directly using ext4 structures.
- The implementation uses 32-bit block addresses and 32-byte group descriptors.
- Images are deliberately created without a journal.
- Sparse files, inline/shared xattrs, SELinux validation, and UUID generation
  are not implemented yet.
- Host import preserves the portable subset of metadata supported by the host
  OS. OCI import applies layer metadata, whiteouts (including opaque
  directories), and hard links; only linux/amd64 images and anonymous registry
  access are supported.
