# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working on `ext4kit`. Read this before making
changes; the user-facing docs are [README.md](README.md) and [docs/](docs/).

## What this is

A Rust library + CLI that writes **real ext4 images from scratch**, without
Linux, `mke2fs` or a loop mount. The main platform is Windows. Sources come
from host directories (`--add`) and from OCI images in a registry or a local
Podman/Docker engine (`--from`). The images get attached to Linux VMs.

Correctness is judged by `e2fsck`, not by whether the code runs. A bug usually
produces an image that the kernel mounts with silent corruption, so every
on-disk change has to be verified with e2fsprogs (see [Verifying images](#verifying-images)).

## Commands

```sh
cargo build
cargo test --lib --bins          # unit tests, offline, well under a second
cargo test --test cli            # end-to-end: builds images and runs e2fsck (~15 s)
cargo test                       # both of the above
cargo test --test oci -- --ignored  # --from tests; need network and Docker
cargo test <name_substring>      # a single test
cargo fmt                        # CI-style check: cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets       # must report zero warnings
cargo run -- create --add <SRC>[:/DEST] [--from IMAGE] [--size MIB] out.img
cargo run -- edit out.img <rm|mkdir|chmod|chown|add|write|cat|test|ln> ...
bash scripts/verify-image.sh out.img ['debugfs request' ...]
```

Before you report a change as done, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test` and
`cargo clippy --all-targets` must all pass, and clippy must report no
warnings. Fix a lint rather than silencing it. Use `#[allow(clippy::…)]`
only with a comment that explains why the code has to stay as it is. If the
change touches anything written to disk, the verify script must exit 0 as
well.

## Layout

The library is layered; a module uses only the layers above it:

1. `ext4::format`: the on-disk format as plain data and encodings, no builder.
2. `ext4`: the filesystem engine, `Ext4ImageBuilder`, which lays out, loads
   and changes an image by **inode number**.
3. `vfs`: name-based access, turning paths into inodes through directories
   and symlinks, and the coreutils-style edits.
4. `host`, `oci`: importers of external content, built on `vfs` and `ext4`.

`main.rs` only parses arguments and orchestrates these.

| Path | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `src/ext4/format/mod.rs` | On-disk structs (`zerocopy`) and constants: `BLOCK_SIZE` = 4096, `INODE_SIZE` = 256, `BLOCKS_PER_GROUP`, inode numbers, file types |
| `src/ext4/format/dirhash.rs`, `xattr.rs` | The half-MD4 directory hash; xattr name parsing, xattr block encoding (`encode_xattr_block`) and POSIX ACL conversion |
| `src/ext4/mod.rs` | The `Ext4ImageBuilder` struct, `DiskData` (memory, mmap'd file or read-only copy-on-write), constructors, and the `test_support::fresh_builder()` fixture |
| `src/ext4/layout.rs` | Block-group geometry, root and `lost+found`, serializing superblocks, descriptors, bitmaps and inode tables (`commit_metadata`, `write_to_file`) |
| `src/ext4/open.rs` | `Ext4ImageBuilder::open` / `open_read_only` / `from_image`: load an existing ext4kit image, rejecting foreign features and inconsistent counters |
| `src/ext4/allocation.rs` | Block and inode bitmaps: plan, commit and release blocks and inodes, free counts, `ensure_allocation_capacity` |
| `src/ext4/inode.rs` | `PosixMetadata`, inode table access, mode/owner/metadata updates (`set_inode_mode`, `set_owner_recursive`), writing xattr blocks |
| `src/ext4/extent.rs` | Reading and validating extent trees, writing them (`write_extent_tree`), the block runs an inode owns |
| `src/ext4/directory.rs` | `mkdir`, dir-entry add/remove/lookup, recursive removal, directory growth, linear-directory cache |
| `src/ext4/htree.rs` | Hashed (dx) directory indexes |
| `src/ext4/file.rs`, `symlink.rs`, `special.rs` | Regular files (streamed from a `Read`, read back with `read_file`, rewritten in place with `replace_file_contents`), symlinks (fast < 60 bytes / slow), device nodes, FIFOs, sockets |
| `src/vfs/resolve.rs` | Path resolution through symlinks, confined to the image root (`resolve_entry`, `resolve_directory`, `resolve_path`), and `ensure_directory` |
| `src/vfs/edit.rs` | Path-level edits with coreutils semantics (`remove_path`, `make_directory`, `chmod_path`, `chown_path`, `write_path`, `test_path`, ...) behind `ext4kit edit` |
| `src/host/` | Host directory import (`dua-core` walk) and sizing; `tree.rs` is the pre-scanned `HostTree` arena |
| `src/oci/` | Tar layer application with whiteouts (`mod.rs`), registry pulls (`remote.rs`), Docker/Podman engines (`local.rs`) |
| `src/main.rs` | Thin clap CLI: argument parsing, sizing and orchestration only. Filesystem logic belongs in the library |

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the two-pass and
streaming import design.

## Invariants: do not break these

- **Preflight, then commit.** Every mutating builder operation first validates
  input and plans *all* resources it needs: the inode, data blocks,
  extent-tree metadata blocks, the xattr block, and the blocks for parent
  directory growth or an htree split. Only then does it mark anything used
  (`ensure_allocation_capacity` → `mark_inode_used` / `commit_data_blocks`).
  A failed call must leave free counts, bitmaps, link counts and directory
  caches exactly as they were. The `failed_*_preflight_*` tests assert
  this; write the same kind of test for any new operation.
- **Keep counters consistent.** Free block/inode counts in both the superblock
  and the group descriptors, `i_links_count` (a subdirectory increments its
  parent), `i_blocks`, and directory `i_size` must all match what `e2fsck`
  recomputes.
- **Directory caches.** `directory_caches` only covers linear directories. Code
  that rewrites directory blocks outside the normal add/remove paths must call
  `invalidate_directory_cache`.
- **No recursion over trees.** Host import walks a flat, parent-first arena,
  and OCI layers are a stream. Large images must not blow the stack or keep
  per-file payloads in memory. File data is copied from a reader straight into
  its extents.
- **Fixed format choices**, modeled on e2fsprogs: 4 KiB blocks, 256-byte
  inodes, 32-bit block numbers, 32-byte group descriptors, sparse superblocks,
  extents, **no journal**. Changing any of these is a design decision, so ask
  before doing it.
- **Cross-platform.** Windows is the primary target but the code also compiles
  on Unix (`#[cfg(unix)]` / `#[cfg(windows)]` in `host/tree.rs`,
  `oci/local.rs` and `main.rs`). Never derive ext4 paths from `std::path`
  separators. Tar paths split on `/` only, and a `\` is a legal filename
  byte.
- **OCI scope:** linux/amd64 only, anonymous registry access, digest-verified
  layers. `--from` entries keep their image ownership, and `--chown` applies
  only to `--add` content.

## Tests

- Unit tests live in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` beside the code.
- End-to-end tests live in `tests/`. `cli.rs` runs the real binary on
  generated host trees and checks every image with `e2fsck -fn` and
  `debugfs`, using the helpers in `tests/common/mod.rs` (`create`, then
  `Image::check` and `cat`/`stat`/`owner`/`list`). e2fsprogs is found
  natively or through WSL, like the verify script. When it is missing the
  checks are skipped with a note; CI sets `EXT4KIT_REQUIRE_E2FSPROGS=1` so
  they fail instead. `oci.rs` holds `#[ignore]`d `--from` tests that need
  Docker Hub or a Docker engine. `open.rs` reopens created images through
  the library, and `edit.rs` runs sequences of `ext4kit edit` calls.
- Build small images in memory with `Ext4ImageBuilder::new(16)`, then call
  `create_root_dir()`, `create_lost_and_found()` and `reserve_inodes()`
  (`ext4::test_support::fresh_builder()` does this). Assert by reading back
  through the builder (`lookup_dir_entry`, `inode`, `directory_entries`,
  `get_dir_blocks`) and by comparing free counts before and after.
- OCI tests build synthetic tar/gzip layers in memory (`layer()` helper in
  `oci/mod.rs`). Tests that are not `#[ignore]`d must not need the network,
  Docker or Podman.
- Unit tests can't catch a structurally wrong image. For a new on-disk feature,
  add a case to `tests/cli.rs` whose fixture exercises it, and use the
  verify script described next for ad-hoc checks.

## Verifying images

`scripts/verify-image.sh` runs `e2fsck -fn` on an image and exits non-zero on
any finding. It can also run `debugfs -R` requests. It works natively on Linux
and through WSL from Git Bash on Windows; it finds a WSL distro that has
e2fsprogs, or you can set `EXT4KIT_WSL_DISTRO`.

```sh
tmp=$(mktemp -d); command -v cygpath >/dev/null && tmp=$(cygpath -m "$tmp")  # Git Bash: C:/... paths
mkdir -p "$tmp/src/sub" && echo hi > "$tmp/src/sub/a.txt"
cargo run -q -- create --add "$tmp/src:/opt" "$tmp/out.img"
bash scripts/verify-image.sh "$tmp/out.img" 'ls -l /opt/src/sub' 'stat /opt/src/sub/a.txt'
rm -rf "$tmp"
```

Useful `debugfs` requests are `ls -l DIR`, `stat PATH` (extent tree, size,
blocks, ownership), `ea_list PATH` (xattrs), `htree DIR` (dx index) and
`stats` (superblock).
To exercise a feature, generate inputs that hit it: thousands of files in one
directory for htrees, or fragmented or large files for multi-level extent
trees. The `/verify-image` skill in `.claude/skills/` walks through this.

## Gotchas

- **Never commit `*.img` files.** Images are hundreds of MiB to GiB. Create
  them in a temp directory and delete them afterwards.
- Git Bash rewrites POSIX-looking arguments: `/tmp/x:/opt` becomes a `;`-joined
  Windows path list, and backslashes passed to `wsl` vanish. Give `--add` a
  `C:/...` path from `cygpath -m` (as in the snippet above), use
  `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` for `wsl`, or just use the verify script.
- `debugfs -R 'htree DIR'` prints "Directory block does not have space for
  checksum" on every indexed directory. Images built by `mke2fs` without
  `metadata_csum` get the same message, so it is not an ext4kit bug.
- The ext4 hash seed is random per image, so dx-directory layouts differ from
  run to run. Do not write tests that compare whole-image bytes.
- `--from` without `docker://` queries the local engine first. Behavior can
  therefore depend on what Podman/Docker has cached on the machine.
- Reference material: the kernel's ext4 on-disk format docs
  (`Documentation/filesystems/ext4/`) and the e2fsprogs sources
  (`lib/ext2fs/`, `misc/mke2fs.c`). When in doubt, match what `mke2fs`
  writes.

## Conventions

- Rust 2024 edition. Errors use `anyhow` (`bail!`, `anyhow!`, `?`); library
  code returns errors and does not panic on bad input.
- Doc comments state what a function does and what it returns. Comments
  explain *why* (ext4 rules, e2fsprogs compatibility), not what the next line
  does.
- Commits use Conventional Commits with a scope, for example
  `feat(cli): …`, `feat(oci): …`, `refactor: …`, `fix(core): …`. The body
  explains the user-visible motivation.
- When behavior changes, update `README.md` and
  `docs/supported-features.md` in the same change.
